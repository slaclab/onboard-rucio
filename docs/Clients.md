### External Rucio Client Installation

The client and associated CLI has been installed inside the rucio container.

However, it can also be installed outside, as follows:
```
    pip install rucio-clients
```
See [**Install Rucio Client**](https://rucio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing_clients.html).

Then the rest follows the same instructions, e.g. modify [rucio.cfg](./rucio.cfg) for SSH access, 
as noted in the next section.
